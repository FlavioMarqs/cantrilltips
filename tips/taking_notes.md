# Taking notes

There are typically 2 types of note takers:
* `Short and punchy`, with a focus on linking concepts together, and contrasting similar services - all summarised in your own words
* `Really verbose`, almost transcripts of the course / documents, in the original author's words

Short and punchy is the important part. Make sure you take notes *in your own words* and *keep them brief*. Verbose notes are not very effective in getting anything to stick in your mind. Therefore, watch a video and do a lab. Take short notes. Key points only. Your words only. No transcribing what the speaker says.
Must be your words.

> ⚠️ The purpose of notes is to *'set up your brain'*, to create a mental structure which helps you remember. This is less effective if you are too verbose.

Remeber taking nots isnt a 1 shot deal. You need to review and consolidate them, if you want the information to get stuck in long term memory. Spaced repetition is really important here. (see learning how to learn, above)
