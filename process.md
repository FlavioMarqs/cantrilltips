# Process
* Focus only on quality. Concise quality and full understanding
* Beware the risk of passivley watching video after video, you need to focus on UNDERSTANDING not watching, see https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn for more (free) advice on how to learn (from professors of neuroscience) 
* Everything is about maximising the effectiveness not the quantity
* Study smarter and not harder. Sleep. Take breaks. Short notes, very few screenshots. If procrastination is a thing (it will be) google "Tim Urban TED" and pomodoro technique to FOCUS
* Do lots of lab exercises - practise what youâ€™ve just watched, in different ways, experiment and break then fix things.
* Get hands on. Do the labs/demos Adrian designed for his course. If there are any areas that confuse you, do them again. Dive in and play around. That will help you in your career far more than simply memorizing the concepts.
* Use the quiz at the end of each section to anchor knowledge learned.
* Do not move on until you fully understand the content in the videos, ask on slack if your arent 100% sure
* Confused? Have a question? Ask on the [slack community](https://techstudyslack.com/). Use `#exam-question-corner` to dicuss answers with others in the community.
