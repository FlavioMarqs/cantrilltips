# Practice Exams

* Finish all of a course's material **BEFORE** you start on the https://tutorialsdojo.com/ tests. The best value comes from the first time you do them.
* Start doing questions in review mode one question at a time
* First summarise on paper what it is asking you. In your words. 
* Then WHY each answer is right or wrong. Not just “I remember this, it’s C”
* See the answer / explanations. 
* Assess whether you correctly wrote down the same key points and adjust your summary.
* Repeat next question

This can take a long time, but is way more effective than just sitting the paper and looking which you got right/wrong. You should keep doing this until you achieve above >90% score for a practice exam.
