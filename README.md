## Practice Exams (Use tutorialsdojo.com)
You gain the best value from your studies by completing Adrians course first and only then start taking the [TutorialsDoJo.com](tutorialsdojo.com)
exams.
Don't bother using exam dump sites, aside from it being cheating and aainst the AWS exam policy, it's just not effective. The questions are full of errors, and the supposed correct answers are frequently nonsense, meaning these questions actually harm your understanding. Even if they were somehow accurate (they arent) if you cheat your way to a pass, you will most certainly get laughed out of any professional interview within minutes. So it's just not worth it.
