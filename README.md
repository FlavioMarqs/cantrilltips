## Introduction
There are many questions on the TechStudySlack.com community about how best to study for an AWS exam. This site gathers the most effective ways you can use Adrians courses to succeed with your studies. 

## Process
* Focus only on quality. Concise quality and full understanding
* Everything is about maximising the effectiveness not the quantity
* Study smarter and not harder. Sleep. Take breaks. Short notes, very few screenshots.
* Do lots of lab exercises - practise what you’ve just watched, in different ways.

## Taking Notes
There are typically 2 types of note takers:
- Short and punchy, with a focus on linking concepts together, and contrasting similar services - all summarised in your own words
- Or really verbose, almost transcripts of the course / documents, in the original authors words
Its option 1 thats the important part. Make sure you take notes in your own words and keep them brief. Option 2 is not very effective, to get anything to stick in your mind
* So watch a video and do a lab. Take short notes. Key points only. Your words only. No transcribing what the speaker says. Must be your words.
* Purpose of notes is to set up your brain. Create your mental structure to help you remember. Doesn’t work if they are too verbose

## Practice E xams (Use tutorialsdojo.com)
* Start doing questions in review mode one question at a time
* First summarise on paper what it is asking you. In your words. 
* Then WHY each answer is right or wrong. Not just “I remember this, it’s C”
* See the answer / explanations. 
* Assess whether you correctly wrote down the same key points and adjust your summary.
* Repeat next question
This takes a long. But is way more effective than just sitting the paper and looking which you got right/wrong.
You need to keep doing this till you’re getting >95% correct
