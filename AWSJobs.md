# Tips and tricks with getting a JOB in AWS
Information here is gathered from discussions on TechStudyslack. Thanx to John O, Sameer, Adrian (ofc) and many others for contributing. 

## Getting a job with your AWS experience
* Length of your CV should be 2 or 3 pages max. Font size 10 minimum. Normal margins. Do not do “wall of text” or death by bullet points. Always better to land 3 messages than 20. Nobody is reading 20 page CVs
* Use the https://resumeworded.com/ to improve your CV
* Content should say what you did, including a so what or a “who cares”. What impact did your work have on the end customer/user. What difference did you make, what were you responsible for, what did you take accountability for, what innovation did you bring or what risks did you mitigate - this is more interesting than listing 200 technologies. Consider numbers: budget managed, people you led, money saved, number of users serves, number of transactions per second - whatever helps people understand scale
* Try to say what makes you tick / what you are looking for - is it quality or innovation, or helping customers or developing others, or learning new things, working on certain things
* Attitude & alignment to company values > skill and knowledge. You can teach skill but not attitude. So if you are interviewing at AWS know what their leadership principles are and make sure they come across in your cv. Same concept every employer. You want to ensure the recruiter you will fit in, that you're one of them. Same if you're going for leadership jobs. Describe your leadership style
* Sell yourself.  But Be honest. You can emphasise skills and shape your image a bit. But claiming stuff you can't back up at interview is a major no no. I interviewed a guy claiming to had designed loads of VPNs. He couldn't answer any questions in VPNs so that immediately undermined everything else he claimed
* Make it stand out and be memorable - some how 
* Cover your ambitions. Where you want to be or what you want from your next role
* How do you keep up with trends - mention certs you have/want, blogs you write, talks you've given -value you add, what extra curricular stuff they can expect from you
* Use the STAR method to explain your experience. Situation, Task, Actions, Results. Describe the situation, list the task involved and the actions you took to improve the situation and the results you achieved.

## Some interview questions
Go through these and think about situations that you encountered and how you handled them; write it down. If you didn't encounter it think about how you would handle it if you ever came across such a situation.
* Tell me about a time when you handled a challenging situation.
* Tell me about a time when you made a mistake. What did you do to correct it? Tell about a project that failed. How did you handle it? Can you give an example of a time when you wish you’d handled a situation differently? What was it and how do you wish you’d handled it instead? Why?

Difficult or unpopular to say and you went ahead and said it./Take risk on a new solution.
* Share an example of how you were able to motivate a coworker, your peers or your team. How you provided good and constructive feedback. Sub-ordinate had a developmental issue and how you helped him.
* Share an example of how you had a disagreement/conflict with a superior Have you ever worked with a difficult boss? In what way was the boss difficult, and how did you handle it? Tell about a time when you knew your boss was wrong. How did you handle the situation?

* Lay out VPCs. Zone subnets. Public and private. Add IGW, natGW, DX back to on prem. dns. Ad. Monitoring, logging, config
* Can you put a three tier app into that account? How do you scale it, secure it, make it resilient, add operations features - basically work thru the well architected framework
* Then how do you do other stuff like private link to a SaaS service, or setup redshift for analytics, or migrate data from a legacy thing (these are all scenarios you know super well from SAP) (edited) 
* What happenes when you type Amazon.com into a web browser (tcp, dns, TLS, webserver)
* What is the cloud (maybe sell the benefits of cloud to me)
* What is a container & why would I use one
* What is kubernetes
* Explain CICD to me in much detail
* What's risk management / how do you do it. Tell me about a big risk you took.
* How do you learn things
* What's your biggest failure / what have you learnt / what would you do differently
* What happened to Facebook & how would you have debugged or prevented it
* How would you let a client down / give them bad news like missing a release
