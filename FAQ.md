## How many hours do videos take?

This question has been asked numerous times on [TechStudySlack](https://techstudyslack.com/). So much so, that a student Sherif Fanous created a site that 
Sherif built this Webapp. There are also charts showing the ooverlap between courses. Check it out.

## Why do I get an error creating accounts

An error "You have exceeded the allowed number of AWS accounts" is sometimes seen even though you are way below the quota maximum. There is a bug. It's been 
around for some time now. It shows "10", but for new accounts the quota is actually set to "2". From discussions on [TechStudySlack](https://techstudyslack.com/)
this error can be seen after some unknown/unspecified period. It grows to the displayed value of 10. Logging a ticket with AWS can help expedite this.

## Whats Adrians Roadmap for new courses?

Adrian has put a notion site together which he keeps updated.

## What is the best path to take through the AWS certifications?

Best answer is "It depends" on the role you are going for :-) The certs are divided into Associate and Professional. The specialities are also considered 
Professional. For most people wanting to work with AWS, its best to take the Solutions Architect - Associate (SAA-C02) first to give you the broadest knowledge 
of AWS. Then you can take the other associates; Developer (DVA-01) and SysOps (SOA-C02) or go directly to the Solutions Architect - Professional (SAP-C01) if you
have worked with AWS and feel comfortable moving on to the SAP. Remember: The SAP certification is broad and deep across all AWS services and takes a serious 
focus on study. 

If you do get the SAP-C01, its also a good idea to take the AWS Certified Security - Specialty soon after the SAP-C01 as many of the topics are 
covered already in Adrians SAP-C01 course (with extra reading on AWS KMS). Then the rest of the specialties can be taken in any order. 

## Do I need to create new accounts for the course?

Yes. Create new accounts for each course you take. THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT. 
Accounts in AWS are disposable and give you the permission boundary needed to contain your labs etc. Dont use
existing accounts either as they might have password policies and other contraints that will give you problems during the course. Take the time to create new 
accounts. It will make your life easier :-)

## Are my associate certifications renewed when I pass a professional certification?

As soon as you pass a Professional exam, the relevant **ACTIVE** associate certifications are automatically renewed. If you pass the DevOps Professional 
certification, then both Dev Associate and SysOps Associate are renewed instantly. If you pass the Architect Professional certification, then Architect 
Associate is renewed.
