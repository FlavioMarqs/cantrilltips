## How long do videos take?

This question has been asked numerous times on [TechStudySlack](https://techstudyslack.com/). So much so, that a student Sherif Fanous created a site that 
Sherif built this Webapp. There are also charts showing the ooverlap between courses. Check it out.

## Why do I get an error creating accounts

An error "You have exceeded the allowed number of AWS accounts" is sometimes seen even though you are way below the quota maximum. There is a bug. It's been around 
for some time now. It shows "10", but for new accounts the quota is actually set to "2". From discussions on [TechStudySlack](https://techstudyslack.com/) this error
can be seen after some unknown/unspecified period. It grows to the displayed value of 10. Logging a ticket with AWS can help expedite this.
